# SnapVision
  SnapVision will develop a video processing application that runs on the Snapdragonâ„¢ SoC development board.  The application will process a video stream and stitch adjacent frames into a mosaic.    There are many possible use cases for this project.  

Some examples include: 
  *Aiding in search and rescue operations in hostile environments. 
  *Looking into population density in order to solve communication issues, heavy traffic concentrations, etc. 
  *Improving crop yield by identifying areas with poor irrigation or disease. Finding broken fences or equipment. 
  *Searching incoming weather patterns for abnormal behavior.  

  After looking at the viability of both MATLAB and C++, SnapVision decided to go with C++ and the OpenCV library to complete the image stitching process. Further, we will discuss the project with our chosen subject matter expert to gain additional knowledge about the current research regarding image processing techniques. The next step in the approach after the application is developed and tested would be to run it on the DragonBoard 410c provided by Qualcomm.
